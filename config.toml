<details>
    <summary style="font-weight: bold">How to Pitch Your Research</summary>
    <div style="font-style: italic">An important part of academic training is learning to communicate effectively to other researchers in the peer community. However, sometimes you need to communicate to someone outside of the peer community, for example: writing a grant application, talking to a journalist, or explaining your research to a potential employer/collaborator with a different educational background. We will discuss some common pitfalls in such endeavors and talk about how you may practice pitching your research by using a large language model. Finally, we work in small groups on concrete case studies.</div>
